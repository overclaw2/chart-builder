⚠️ Parallel Work
   Most tasks sequential; identify opportunities for parallel development

STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS 📋
=============================

1. Implement QA Plan
   Deploy the comprehensive E2E testing strategy created Feb 14

2. Monitor Dark Mode
   Gather user feedback on theme detection and white-label customization

3. Evaluate Drag-Drop Stability
   Confirm all 3 drag-drop fixes remain stable in production

4. Optimize Conveyor Window
   Monitor new row-based layout for usability improvements

5. Plan Next Sprint
   With foundation complete, plan feature velocity for next phase

6. Documentation
   Create architecture documentation for conveyor window refactoring

7. Cost Analysis
   Review high-cost tasks (>10m) for pre-planning efficiency improvements
