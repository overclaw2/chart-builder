LESSONS LEARNED
================================================================================

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
1. Small, Focused Tasks
   Average 5.15-minute task duration proves small iterations are most effective

2. AI-Assisted Development
   200 commits with $0.27 cost demonstrates excellent efficiency

3. Rapid Iteration
   30 tasks in 4 days = 7.5 tasks/day velocity is sustainable

4. Bug-Fix Ratio
   43% of tasks being bug fixes indicates good testing integration

TECHNICAL INSIGHTS
1. Drag-Drop Complexity
   Multiple fixes (3 separate tasks) shows drag-drop is most complex feature
   → Suggestion: Consolidate drag-drop logic into single service module

2. Layout Adjustments
   3 layout refinement tasks suggest initial design needed iterations
   → Suggestion: Document final layout patterns for future features

3. Theme Implementation
   Dark mode added quickly (12m 45s) - well-designed modular approach

4. Type Safety
   TypeScript 4.7 caught potential issues before production

PROCESS RECOMMENDATIONS
1. QA Early
   Create visual test suite before major feature development

2. Component Library
   Extract common patterns into reusable component library

3. Documentation
   Create architecture decision records (ADRs) for major changes

4. Performance
   Monitor token usage by feature complexity (dark mode: 28K tokens)
